    <main>

        <p class="surah">The majority of his life was in the fitna</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair takes the most aggressive approach </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair was one for the battlefield and always felt a sense of justice</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair was very close to Uthman </p>
        <p class="surah">Uthman was very lovable and he was very soft and lenient </p>
        <p class="surah">The Angels were shy from Uthman </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair was devastated when Uthman was killed </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair went out with Talha and Ayesha and they made their way towards Ali</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair met his father when Uthman got assassinated </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair stood with Ali and reminded of the moment when the Prophet said do you love Ali </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said yes of course </p>
        <p class="surah">Prophet said you will one day fight against Ali and you will be wrong </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair gave allegiance to Ali</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said his father came and said look at me</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair's father showed his legs filled with wounds </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair's father said all these wounds were fought for the Prophet </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair says his father called him saying one day you will be killed as an oppressor or an oppressed one </p>
        <p class="surah">Az Zubair felt he will die as an oppressed so he told his son to pay off his debts </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair sold all his property and paid of his debts </p>
        <p class="surah">1/3 for his sons, 1/3 to pay debts, 1/3 for Abdullah's sons</p>
        <p class="surah">Az Zubair said if you cannot pay off my debts than seek help from my Master</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said who is your Master and he replied Allah </p>
        <p class="surah">Az Zubair was killed in his salah </p>
        <p class="surah">Ali found out and said glad tidings for the killers of Zubair will be in hell fire</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair payed off his debt and he had nothing left</p>
        <p class="surah">Then He called O Master of Zubair then things started to open up</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair is constantly finding out about all this wealth </p>
        <p class="surah">Zubair owed $2,002,000 dirhams</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair went to his uncle and asked for some help</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said who will buy this land and he said O master calling to Allah</p>
        <p class="surah">Then someone came and bought the land for $1,000,000 dirhams</p>
        <p class="surah">Then he payed off half the debts</p>
        <p class="surah">One time Ibn Zubair is in charge of Makkah </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair passed a comment that he will take her money and manage it</p>
        <p class="surah">Ayesha heard and said I will never to speak to Ibn Zubair again </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair heard and he felt so overwhelmed </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair sent people to Ayesha to accept intercession </p>
        <p class="surah">Ayesha did not accept the intercession </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair goes to the elders of Sahaba to speak with Ayesha</p>
        <p class="surah">They walk in the Hujarat </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair goes behind the curtain and grabs Ayesha and starts crying </p>
        <p class="surah">The Sahaba tell her to forgive him</p>
        <p class="surah">Ayesha said I can't I took an oath </p>
        <p class="surah">Ayesha forgave him and freed 40 slaves to compensate for the oath </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair and Ayesha had a very solid relationship</p>
        <p class="surah">When Ayesha was passing away she sent her will to Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">Ayesha said bury me in Baqi with the other wives </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair prayed the janaza of Ayesha and carried out the burial</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair was quick to revolt against the tyrant</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas said No one has more right to than Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas said Ibn Zubair is a pure chaste person </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas said There is nothing between me and him</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas and Ibn Zubair would compete in zakah</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas and Ibn Zubair would argue over figh matters</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas and Ibn Zubair were business partners </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair and Ibn Umar were also business partners </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said I don't know who is more generous Ayesha or Asma </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair is leading the salah like the Prophet </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas said look to Ibn Zubair for salah of the Prophet </p>
        <p class="surah">All the Sahaba has same opinion but different approaches </p>
        <p class="surah">Hasan makes peace with Muawwiah </p>
        <p class="surah">Hasan died 9 years later</p>
        <p class="surah">The Ummah is progressing </p>
        <p class="surah">Islam is spreading throughout the world </p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah feels his life is ending </p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah consults the people around who to rule next</p>
        <p class="surah">The people of Sham had Muawwiah has leader since the time of Umar bin Khattab</p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah is capable to lead the people of Sham </p>
        <p class="surah">Sham had become a place of prosperity</p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah decides to appoint Yazeed in 57 AH</p>
        <p class="surah">7 people stood against </p>
        <p class="surah">All 4 Abdullahs, Ayesha, Hussein, and Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr </p>
        <p class="surah">Abdul Rahman bin Abu Bakr took the harshest stance and said he will kill Yazeed if he rules </p>
        <p class="surah">Abdul Rahman bin Abu Bakr unfortunately died shortly after so he did not do anything</p>
        <p class="surah">Ayesha dies a year later as well</p>
        <p class="surah">The other 5 are left </p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah leaves them alone and there is no violence taking place </p>
        <p class="surah">60 AH Muawwiah feels ill and he reinforces the bayah to Yazeed all around the Ummah </p>
        <p class="surah">The Abdillah and Hussein avoid it </p>
        <p class="surah">The Ummah starts with Prophethood then Khalifah then righteous kings then tyrants</p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah is a righteous king </p>
        <p class="surah">After Righteous kings are tyrants then Khalifah with accordance to the Prophet </p>
        <p class="surah">Abdillah and Hussein are in Makkah and Madinah</p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah sends Ad Duhka that if you see Yazeed beware of people of Iraq </p>
        <p class="surah">In Iraq governors are constantly being replaced and it was very volatile</p>
        <p class="surah">Do not mess with them and if they ask you of anything do it</p>
        <p class="surah">Satisfy the people of Iraq</p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah said Take hold of the people of Sham like I did </p>
        <p class="surah">Beware of 3 people of Quresh Hussein, Ibn Zubair, and Ibn Umar </p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah passes away and Yazeed takes</p>
        <p class="surah">Yazeed becomes Khalifah and takes his fathers advice </p>
        <p class="surah">Waleed bin Utbah is the governor of Madinah and he is sent a letter from Yazeed </p>
        <p class="surah">Yazeed tells him to find Ibn Umar, Ibn Zubair, and Hussein and have them give bayah to me</p>
        <p class="surah">Waleed calls Hussein quietly </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein says I will do it publicly </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein then tells Ibn Zubair and Ibn Umar what happened </p>
        <p class="surah">All of the them except for Ibn Umar flee from Madinah </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas did not agree with Yazeed but did not take any political action</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair and Hussein revolt against Yazeed in Makkah </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas came back from Umrah when Hussein and Ibn Zubair told them about what happened </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein gets letters from Kufa in Iraq that we give you our support</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair sets up in Makkah </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein considers these letters and he sends Muslims Ibn Akeel ibn Abu Talib to Kufa and told him do not take the main route</p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein will come later if what people of Kufa said is true or not</p>
        <p class="surah">Muslim bin Akeel gets to Kufa he starts to meet with people </p>
        <p class="surah">Numan ibn Bashir is the governor of Kufa and he leaves him alone</p>
        <p class="surah">Yazeed founds out about the revolt and Muslim takes bayah from 15,000 to fight Yazeed </p>
        <p class="surah">Yazeed sends Obaidullah Ibn Ziad to Kufa to replace Ibn Bashir</p>
        <p class="surah">Muslim bin Akeel goes into hiding</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Ziad said if anyone is sheltering those against Yazeed will die</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Ziad sends a spy and founds out where Muslim is </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Ziad calls Hani bin Urwa and tells him do you have muslim with you</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Ziad asked to get Muslim bin Akeel</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Ziad hits Hani and locks him in the room </p>
        <p class="surah">Muslim bin Akeel heard and tells Hussein to come right away </p>
        <p class="surah">It was initially intended not to be violent </p>
        <p class="surah">Muslim summons his people and they all abandon him </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Ziad brings a whole army and Muslim runs and hides in the house </p>
        <p class="surah">Muslim came out and was caught and was killed along with Hani</p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein is telling the Abdillah what is going on</p>
        <p class="surah">All the Abdullahs stop Hussein from going to Kufa</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said lets do it from Makkah</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas said lets do it from Yemen </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein was massacred in Karbala</p>
        <p class="surah">News got out that Hussein was killed and the whole Ummah united against Yazeed </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair declared Khalifah and revolted against Yazeed in 60 AH</p>
        <p class="surah">Makkah automatically gives him Bayah and so do the people of Madinah </p>
        <p class="surah">Yazeed finds out and sends an army to Makkah</p>
        <p class="surah">On the way to Makkah they hear of a revolt in Madinah </p>
        <p class="surah">They redirect to Madinah and a Massacre happens where a lot of Sahaba were killed</p>
        <p class="surah">They killed 5,000 people in Madinah </p>
        <p class="surah">Muslim bin Ukbah led that revolt and he dies shortly after</p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein ibn Numair is now in charge</p>
        <p class="surah">Around the world people give bayah to Ibn Zubair as they hear</p>
        <p class="surah">Khawaritte align themselves with Ibn Zubair </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein ibn Numair decides to kill Ibn Zubair </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair was strong in Makkah</p>
        <p class="surah">So they shoot catapults in Makkah </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair sets up tents around the Kaaba and they attacked the Kaaba too</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair was in salah and the kaaba caught on fire so people took out the fire</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair rebuilds the Kaaba in its original rectangular shape with two doors </p>
        <p class="surah">Yemani corner and Hajra Aswad were the original corners of the Kaaba </p>
        <p class="surah">Muawwiah was young and religious </p>
        <p class="surah">As he was dying the people told him to find a successor</p>
        <p class="surah">He wanted to appoint someone like Umar like Abu Bakr did</p>
        <p class="surah">But there was no one like Umar</p>
        <p class="surah">He wanted to appoint a shura like Umar but there was no one like that</p>
        <p class="surah">So Muawwiah died with no successor</p>
        <p class="surah">The only Khalifah left in Makkah is Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair did not want anyone to be in his army who insulted the sahaba</p>
        <p class="surah">After Yazeed died Muslims came to Ibn Zubair to give bayah</p>
        <p class="surah">The whole world is under Ibn Zubair now</p>
        <p class="surah">Some remnants of Banu Ummayah give bayah to Ibn Zubair </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair was the only Khalifah to rule from Makkah</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Ziad talks Banu Ummayyah to revolt against Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">Banu Ummayah gives bayah to Marwan bin Hakam</p>
        <p class="surah">Marwan Bin Hakam fights for Khalifah in Sham</p>
        <p class="surah">Banu Ummayah had keys to Bait ul Mal and bought people off</p>
        <p class="surah">Banu Ummayah reclaimed the Khalifah in Sham</p>
        <p class="surah">Now there are two Khalifahs</p>
        <p class="surah">There are the group of people in Iraq called the repenters  </p>
        <p class="surah">71 AH during Hajj there are 4 groups of Muslims </p>
