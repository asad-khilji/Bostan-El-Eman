    <main>

      <h3 class="surah">Bismillah</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>I begin with the name of Allah</li>
            <li>My beginning is with the name of Allah</li>
            <li>The first ayah revealed was Surah Al Alaq Ayah 1-5</li>
            <li>Allah mentions in Surah Alaq Ayah 1 Read in the name of your Master</li>
            <li>The Quran begins with the name of Allah</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="surah">The Two types of Knowledge</h3>
        <ol class="surah">
            <li>Beneficial Knowledge</li>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>To make yourself better</li>
                    <li>To improve oneself</li>
                    <li>To get you closer to Allah</li>
                    <li>To purify yourself</li>
                    <li>Allah requires us to use our intellect</li>
                    <li>Our knowledge should be accompanied with the name of Allah</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Non Beneficial Knowledge</li>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>There is a lot of information but no transformation</li>
                    <li>Like on social media</li>
                    <li>Allah repeats throughout the Quran don't you think</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

    <h3 class="surah">The Name of Allah</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>The first name of Allah is Allah</li>
            <li>The word Allah is always before any of His other names</li>
            <li>The name Allah is only exclusive to Allah</li>
            <li>No one and nothing is like Allah</li>
            <li>We worship Allah out of fear and love</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="surah">Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>These two names are derived from love and care</li>
            <li>Ar Rahman is the second name of Allah after the name Allah</li>
            <li>Allah says call on Allah then call on Ar Rahman</li>
            <li>Rahman is love and care for all people</li>
            <li>Raheem is love and care only for the believers</li>
            <li>Ar Rahman is a title and an attribute exclusive to Allah</li>
            <li>Our love and care is nothing compared to Allah's love and care</li>
            <li>Allah has 100 parts of His love and care</li>
            <li>One Part of Allah's love and care is for everyone in this world</li>
            <li>The other 99 parts of Allah's love and care is for the believers on the day of judgement</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="surah">Is Bismillah a Part of the Fatiha?</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>Imam Shafi says that Bismillah is part of the Fatihah</li>
            <li>Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Malik, and Imam Ahmad say Bismillah is not part of the Fatihah</li>
            <li>Most scholars say that Bismillah is not part of the Fatihah</li>
            <li>Bismillah is at the beginning of every surah except Surah At Tawbah and in one ayah in Surah Naml</li>
            <li>Bismillah occurs 114 times in the Quran</li>
            <li>In Hadith Qudsi Allah mentions the Fatihah and begins with Alhamdulillah and not Bismillah</li>
            <li>The Prophet would say the Fatihah out loud and Bismillah silently</li>
        </ul>

            <li>There are two ways of reading this ayah</li>
            <li>The owner of the day of judgement and the king of the day of judgment</li>
            <li>The Human being can be either an Owner or a King</li>
            <li>Allah is both an Owner and a King</li>
            <li>Alah is the King of All Kings and the Owner of All things</li>
            <li>There is no day after it</li>
            <li>There is no night to follow it</li>
            <li>The eternal day</li>
            <li>Allah is the owner and king of this day</li>

            <li>The angel of death has taken the souls of all people, angels, and jinn</li>
            <li>Allah asks the angel of death who remains</li>
            <li>The angel of death replies I remain, Jibril remains, and your noble face</li>
            <li>Allah orders the angel of death to take the soul of Jibril</li>
            <li>Then Allah asks the angel of death who remains</li>
            <li>The angel of death replies I remain and Your Noble Face</li>
            <li>Allah orders the angel of death to take his own soul</li>
            <li>Nothing is left except the Noble Face of Your Master</li>
            <li>Allah asks who owns dominion this day and no one answers</li>
            <li>Then Allah answers Himself He is the King of All Kings and for Him is all dominion</li>
