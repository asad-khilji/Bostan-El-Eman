                <li>Abdullah did not have tahneek done to him because there were no dates</li>
                <li>The Prophet held Abdullah close and made dua for him</li>
                <li>Abdullah's Tahneek was the saliva of Prophet</li>
                <li>The Prophet did not see Abdullah until years later when he made hijrah</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Household of the Prophet</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>The prophet had 12 uncles</li>
                <li>8 of them died before Prophet received revelation</li>
                <li>4 of them died after the Prophet received revelation</li>
                    <ol class="surah">
                        <li>Abu Lahab</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>Died in Disbelief</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Abu Talib</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>Died in Disbelief</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Al Abbas</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>He became a muslim</li>
                                <li>He was 3 years older than the Prophet</li>
                                <li>His name means lion</li>
                                <li>Every one loved him</li>
                                <li>He would bring family together</li>
                                <li>He did not have the status of Abu Talib because he was young</li>
                                <li>He was very generous with his family members</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Hamza</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>He was martyred as a Muslim</li>
                                <li>He was close to the age of the Prophet</li>
                                <li>His name means lion</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ol>
                <li>When the Prophet moved to Madinah Al Abbas introduced him to the Ansar</li>
                <li>Al Abbas did not think the Ansar could take care of the Prophet</li>
                <li>The Ansar were very young like in there 20s</li>
                <li>Al Abbas said to the Ansar are you sure you will take care of the Prophet</li>
                <li>Because the Ansar would be wanted and killed by everyone</li>
                <li>So the Ansar took a pledge with everything</li>
                <li>Al Abbas and Abu Lahab are very close brothers</li>
                <li>Abdullah bin Abbas says we were from the weak and oppressed from Makkah</li>
                <li>Because they were a Muslim Household but they did not announce their Islam</li>
                <li>Abdullah bin Abbas's mother accepted Islam the same day as Khadija and they both were good friends</li>
                <li>Fatima bin Khattab the sister of Umar also accepted Islam with Khadija and the Mother of Abdullah bin Abbas</li>
                <li>The Khala of Abdullah bin Abbas whose name was Maymuna bin Harith is the wife of the Prophet</li>
                <li>The Prophet married Maymuna 6 months after hijra around the time of the treaty of hudaibia</li>
                <li>Abdullah bin Abbas is the second youngest sibling and he has one younger brother Ubaidullah</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Battle of Badr</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>During the Battle of Badr the Prophet sees his uncle Abbas again</li>
                <li>Unfortunately he joined the side of the disbelievers</li>
                <li>Because he was forced to fight Muhammad</li>
                <li>Umar bin Khattab heard Al Abbas is coming to fight at Badr</li>
                <li>Umar said he will kill him</li>
                <li>Prophet said O Aba Hafs</li>
                <li>And it was the first time Prophet called Umar Aba Hafs so he remembers</li>
                <li>He says it is really befitting that an Uncle of the Prophet be struck with a sword</li>
                <li>The Prophet kept saying it to Umar</li>
                <li>After Badr Al Abbas is pacing and tearing up</li>
                <li>He laid down and he stayed awake</li>
                <li>Prophet heard him groaning while a prisoner</li>
                <li>Prophet said loosen the chains on all of the prisoners</li>
                <li>All the different tribes came with ransom to free their relatives</li>
                <li>No one came to ransom Al Abbas</li>
                <li>The Prophet was saddened that no one came</li>
                <li>Anas bin Malik said some of the Ansar came to the Prophet and said to the Prophet let us ransom Al Abbas</li>
                <li>Because the Ansar were related to Al Abbas but the Prophet said no</li>
                <li>Al Abbas said to the Prophet you know I accepted Islam</li>
                <li>Prophet says to him Allah knows that you really are a believer</li>
                <li>Allah will free you and reward you</li>
                <li>What was apparent you were fighting amongst us</li>
                <li>So free yourself and free your cousins Nawfal bin Harith, Ateeq bin Abu Talib, and Utbah</li>
                <li>Al Abbas said to the Prophet I don’t have any money</li>
                <li>Prophet says where is the money you buried</li>
                <li>Al Abbas said how did you know, no body knows</li>
                <li>The Prophet said ransom yourself with that money</li>
                <li>Allah will reward you</li>
                <li>Al Abbas said can I use the spoils of war too and the Prophet said no</li>
                <li>Al Abbas ransomed himself and his cousins </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">After the Battle of Badr</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Allah revealed to the Prophet</li>
                <li>O Prophet say to those who are in your control of the captives</li>
                <li>Allah knows the good in your hearts He will give you something better than that was taken from you</li>
                <li>Allah will forgive and Allah is most forgiving and loving and caring</li>
                <li>The above verse was revealed for Al Abbas</li>
                <li>Al Abbas said that after Badr Allah gave me 20 servants in place of the 20 I gave to ransom with</li>
                <li>Al Abbas hoped for Allah’s forgiveness</li>
                <li>Abu Sufayan comes and Abu Lahab says what happened</li>
                <li>Abu Sufayan said we found them small and victorious</li>
                <li>They killed us and captured us</li>
                <li>They were men with them that filled the sky</li>
                <li>They could strike us but we could not strike them and they were referring to the angels</li>
                <li>Abu Rafi said I heard and could not contain the joy in my heart</li>
                <li>Abu raif jumped up and said I swear by Allah those are the angels</li>
                <li>When he did that Abu Lahab beat him almost to death</li>
                <li>Um Fadil saw this and took something and hit the head of Abu Lahab</li>
                <li>Umm Fadil exposed his skull and the blood came down</li>
                <li>Um Fadil said to Abu Lahab that do you think you can take advantage of him because his master is not here</li>
                <li>The strike on the head of Abu Lahab may have caused his death a week later</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Conquest of Makkah</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Al Abbas comes with his family and officially accepts Islam right before Fath Al Makkah in the year 630</li>
                <li>Now everything is set</li>
                <li>The Prophet said Abbas is from me and I am from him</li>
                <li>When Abbas walked into the room the Prophet would stand up and kiss him on the forehead</li>
                <li>The Prophet said this is my uncle</li>
                <li>Even though Abbas is the Prophets uncle, Al Abbas addresses him as the Messenger of Allah</li>
                <li>Prophet said why should I not say that when you are my uncle</li>
                <li>You are what is left of my father and the uncle is like a father</li>
                <li>Abbas told the Prophet Abu Sufuyan is a man of pride</li>
                <li>He is Muslim but a man of pride</li>
                <li>So Abbas said whenever you come to Makkah you announce places of safety</li>
                <li>Make the house of Abu Sufuyan a place of safety</li>
            </ul>
