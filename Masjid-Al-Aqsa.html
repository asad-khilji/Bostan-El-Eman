        <h1>Masjid Al Aqsa</h1>
        <h3>By: Dr. Omar Suleiman</h3>

    <main>

        <p class="surah">The masjid is not more holy than human life. Salahuddin loved Palestine because of Masjid Al Aqsa. When masjid al aqsa was desecrated muslims did not cringe. Salahuddin convinces muslims that Masjid Al Aqsa is very dear to our hearts. We make dua for masjid al aqsa to be free. Masjid al haram was built first and masjid al aqsa was built after that. The time of construction between the two masjid was only 40 years. It was both built by Adam. Ibrahim just raised the foundation for both masjid. These Masjid become the focal point of Ibadah. Aqsa means the furtherest masjid from haram. Jeruselem is the place where Ibrahim lived. Aqsa is a place which is blessed and sanctified. Allah blessed the masjid and the land around it.</p>

        <p class="surah">The Prophet Yaqoob settled in Palestine, but after the famine they left and settled in Egypt. At time of Musa they fled Egypt and went to Palestine. Musa told his people to enter holy land. This land purifies you and forgives your sins. When Musa says let’s go to his people they said we can’t their are big people there. The nation of Musa at the time consisted of 600,000 people and out of them only 2 people were willing to go. Allah forbids them from Palestine for 40 years. The people who worshipped the calf did not enter the land and died before that. Their children entered the holy land. Musa could not enter either as he died before that. Musa said O Allah among the countries you chose Palestine and among the cities you chose Jerusalem and among that you chose al aqsa. Musa asked to be buried next to Jerusalem. Musa has made Hajj because he longed to go to Aqsa and he made the intention. </p>

        <p class="surah">At the time of Yusha, the children of Israel enter the holy land and start to fight with the people for it. The children of Israel could not fight on the sabbath and the sun was setting in time for the sabbath. So Allah stopped the sun for him. Yusha brings Jerusalem in 6 days. The people became wicked and Allah destroys them. Then we have Talut and Dawood. Dawood kills Jalut then Dawood reigns in Palestine. Suleiman takes over and it is 940 years before Isa. Suleiman builds 40 masjid around the world. Suleiman builds masjid al Aqsa as it it seen today. Suleiman asked Allah for sound judgement. He asks Allah for a kingdom only for him. He asks Allah that no one will come except to pray and they will be purified from sin. So many different movements attached to Suleiman and his temple. The first destruction of temple of Suleiman 690 years before Isa then it was rebuilt. </p>

        <p class="surah">Maryam was dedicated in al aqsa. Zakriya asked dua and was given Yahya in aqsa. When they killed Yahya Aqsa is destroyed again. Christians expels the Jews from Jersulem. For 300 years they did not enter Palestine. When the prophet Muhammad was born a light comes from Aminah and it showed Busra in Sham. This part of the world will come to the prophet Muhammad. Busra was the first city to come to Muslims. Prophet Muhammad faced Aqsa and then the Kaaba. Prophet Muhammad saw a light of Quran from under his pillow and his sight follows Sham. The people of Sham will hold onto their faith. </p>

        <p class="surah">Prophet Muhammad is asleep in the Hateem of the Kaaba. Jibril comes and opens the chest and washes the heart of the Prophet with faith and wisdom. A physical journey was made from masjid al haram to masjid al Aqsa. There is not an inch in the entire city of Jerusalem except an angel or a Prophet stood in that area. Prophet Muhammad rode on the camel travelling at the speed of light. Ibrahim took the same animal for Hajj. Prophet Muhammad travels upon Buraq. Prophet Muhammad enters masjid Aqsa and prays 2 rakah. Then he sees all the prophets in front of him. Prophet Muhammad was shy and Jibril took his hand and put him in front. Prophet Muhammad was offered a drink between milk and wine so he chose the glass of milk. Prophet Muhammad remembers standing in Makkah and Quresh asked little details about Aqsa. Prophet Muhammad was nervous and he could not remember. Prophet Muhammad saw Jersusalem in front of him and answered the most detailed answers </p>

        <p class="surah">After the hijra the Muslims are in Madinah and they pray towards Aqsa for a year. A sign for the Jews was that the Prophet faced the same direction as them. After a year the direction changed in Salat ul zuhr. They felt nervous if Salah was wasted. Allah said He will not waste your imaan. Prophet Muhammad is the only prophet to pray in both qiblas. Prophet Muhammad is the final messenger to all nations. Prophet Muhammad combines both the traditions of Ismail and Ishaq. Anas bin Malik lived a very long life and he described himself that there is no one who prayed both qiblas except him. When the qibla changed there was still a deep connection to Aqsa. There are three masjids Masjid Al Haram,  Masjid Al Nabi, and Masjid Al Aqsa. Just looking at Aqsa is better than the whole world and what it contains. Whoever puts on his haram from Jersulem and goes to Makkah his sins are forgiven it is the route of Ibrahim. </p>

        <p class="surah">Aqsa is the land of Resurrection. We should go to Aqsa and pray there. If you can’t pray there donate to masjid al Aqsa. Allah calls Aqsa the land of olive trees in the Quran. Prophet Muhammad said after his death Jerusalem will come to believers. The Romans and the Persians are two superpowers in time of the Prophet. Damascus, Syria was the capital of the Byzantines. Damascus was taken in 613 AH. Persians occupied Jersulem and kicked out Christians. Jews allied with Persians and Muslims allied with Romans. Allah said Romans will defeat the Persians. The Romans and the Muslims were victorious at the time of Badr. Jews made a third attempt at the temple of Solomon with the help of the Persians. Chrisitians removed the Jews from Jerusalem and made Aqsa into a dumpster. Prophet Muhammad went to Aqsa when it was under Persian rule.</p>

        <p class="surah">At the time of Hudaibia Abu Sufyan met with Heraculius in Jersulem. Heraculius saw a dream that Prophet Muhammad would conquer the Romans and the Persians. Heraculius has a soft spot for Islam, but the people were opposed to it then so he did not accept Islam. After Prophet Muhammad passed the Muslims fight against the Romans in Jordan in 637. Umar Bin Khattab was given the keys to Jerusalem. Umar bin Hattab enters while walking and his servant on the camel because it was his turn. Umar bin Khattab had one garment with dirt and mud on it. Obaid said to Umar what are you doing you should have some dignity. Umar pushes the chest of Obaid and said Allah gave us our dignity not the people.</p>

        <p class="surah">The people were in awe and fell in love with Umar. Umar bin Khattab goes to Aqsa and they clean it up. Umar bin Khattab led Salah there in Al Aqsa. Malik Ibn Marwan built the gold dome with rock inside there where Prophet Muhammad ascended up to the heavens. Bilal was the first to give the azan in Aqsa and other two harams as well. All the companions cried when they heard the azan of Bilal because they remembered Prophet Muhammad. A leader of the church allows Umar to pray in the Church. Umar refuses and prays outside the Church. That place is now masjid Umar. The Christians do not want the Jews back. Umar brings 70 Jewish families back to Jerusalem. </p>

        <p class="surah">In the year 1099, the Christians killed the Muslims, Jews, and eastern orthodox Christians and kicked them out of Jerusalem. Umar took Jerusalem without any bloodshed. The Knights of Templar also known as Solomon’s temple were Christian group who went to king and said let’s take over Aqsa. They made Aqsa into there headquarters. Salahuddein comes in 787 AH and takes back Jerusalem. Salahudin stands and waits to enter Aqsa and treats the enemies well and allows all Muslims, Jews, and Christians to live there peacefully. </p>

        <p class="surah">Ottomon Empire rules for 400 years and people flourished under them. Prophet Muhammad says there will also be a group from my ummah who will be on the truth. They will always be praying there and you cannot stopped them. On the day of judgement the Kaaba will be brought to Jerusalem those who made hajj and umrah will hold onto to cloth of the Kaaba as it is being brought to Jerusalem. An ayah about stopping the name of Allah from being mentioned in masjid is about Aqsa. Human life is more valuable than the masjid.</p>
