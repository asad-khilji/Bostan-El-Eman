                <li>The Prophet liked his answer and his trustworthiness </li>
                <li>If you do not have trust you don't have deen</li>
                <li>The Prophet says bring me an animal that does not produce any milk </li>

                <li>The Prophet grabbed that bucket and drank it and gave it to Abu Bakr</li>
                <li>The Prophet gave ibn masood to drink too </li>
                <li>The sheep went back to not producing milk</li>
                <li>The Prophet thanked Ibn Masood</li>
                <li>Ibn Masood said O my uncle teach me these words you said</li>
