    <main>

        <p class="surah">Umar bin Khattab plays a significant role with Ibn Masood</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood is more of a teacher to Umar</p>
        <p class="surah">When Umar became the Khalifa he tried to Appoint Ibn Masood as a governor</p>
        <p class="surah">Then he tried to make him a treasurer </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood said no to both position </p>
        <p class="surah">Then Umar tried to offer Ibn Masood a salary </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood said why are you distracting me with this dunya</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar was sitting in a gathering and Ibn Masood walked in</p>
        <p class="surah">People stared at Ibn Masood for his height and were belittling him</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar stood up and welcomed Ibn Masood</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar offered his spot and served him and honored him </p>
        <p class="surah">As Ibn Masood walked out Umar posted at him and said he has a lot of knowledge and fiqh </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood and Umar saw someone dragging his clothes under his ankles </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood told him to raise his izar</p>
        <p class="surah">The man said you should raise yours </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar took his stick and hit the young man </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar said are you talking back to Ibn Masood </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar was building a house for Ibn Masood and someone said isn't that enough for Ibn Masood</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar threw a brick at him</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar sent several Sahaba to Kufa but they turned them away</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar sends Ibn Masood to Kufa even though he needed him</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood goes to be the governor of Kufa </p>
        <p class="surah">When Ibn Masood got there the people of Kufa loved him and did not complain</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood taught the people Quran</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar asked for reports for Kufa and he heard people are memorizing Quran</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar asked the people of Kufa what is the greatest part of Quran </p>
        <p class="surah">They all responded with Ayat ul Kursi </p>
        <p class="surah">What about justice</p>
        <p class="surah">They responded with an ayat in Surah nisa</p>
        <p class="surah">What is the most comprehensive ayah</p>
        <p class="surah">Ayah in Surah Zilzal</p>
        <p class="surah">Which ayah gives you hope</p>
        <p class="surah">They said Surah Zumar Ayah 53</p>
        <p class="surah">When they answered that Umar said do you have Ibn Masood amongst you</p>
        <p class="surah">They said yes and Umar got happy and looked for Ibn Masood</p>
        <p class="surah">Umar kissed Ibn Masood on the forehead </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar sits down and asks him questions </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar says he is like a teapot full of knowledge </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar loves him and gives him this position</p>
        <p class="surah">A person comes from Kufa who says someone writes Mushafs from their memory </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar got very angry and asked who is this </p>
        <p class="surah">He said it was Ibn Masood </p>
        <p class="surah">Umar calmed down and said it is ok </p>
        <p class="surah">A person came from Kufa to ask Umar and Umar said you are coming all the way from Kufa to me when I gave you the keeper of the secrets there</p>
