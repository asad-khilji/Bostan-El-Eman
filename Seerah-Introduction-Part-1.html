        <h3 class="surah">The Definition of Seerah</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Linguistic meaning: A path, a path where somebody walks, a direction which somebody takes, to
                    walk in a particular direction</li>
                <li>Figurative meaning: a person’s life, the path that someone has gone on/been in, lived life in a
                    direction of</li>
                <li>Seerah can also be used as a description</li>
                    <ul class="surah">
                        <li>E.g. This person has a beautiful way of life, he has an excellent way of living</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>In Surah Ta’ha, Allah asked Musa (as) what’s in his hand. Musa replied that it is his staff and described it</li>
                    <ul class="surah">
                        <li>Allah then commanded Musa to drop the staff, which became a rapidly moving snake</li>
                        <li>Then Allah commanded Musa to grab the snake and not to be afraid</li>
                    <ul class="surah">
                        <li>“Seize it and fear not; We will return it to its former condition.” [Surah Ta’Ha, 20:21]</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>The word Allah uses is Seerah to mean “first form, former condition.”</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Even your physical form and the way you act/talk/look is a part of your Seerah</li>
                </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Technical terminology</h3>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Seerah is a literary term, and it translates to “biography”</li>
                    <li>Seerah shaksiya – biography of someone</li>
                    <li>Seerah datiyah – autobiography</li>
                    <li>Seeratul Nabawiya – prophetic biography</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>Scholars describe it as everything and anything in connection to the life and times of the Prophet (saw)</li>
                            <li>The Prophet’s attributes, characteristics, physical descriptions, mannerisms, his campaigns, his family/home life, etc. are all part of the Seerah</li>
                            <li>Early compilations and references of Seerah are referred to as Al-Maghazi or Al-Ghazaya, about the military campaigns of Prophet</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Why study Seerah?</h3>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Seerah has been around since Day 1</li>
                    <li>Seerah and the Qur’an go hand in hand</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Seerah has been presented to us in form of books, in Sunday school, or maybe you came across it in some form of text in pamphlet or book. This usually has manifested itself in a couple of unfortunate ways:</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Seerah has been only a dry presentation of facts (only names, dates, and places), almost like a timeline</li>
                    <li>Or Seerah has only been told in a story format, which is necessary</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Traditional study of the Seerah was done in a flowing narrative</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Many of us knew Qur’an through only pure recitation/memorization on its own fairytale, while those of us who are fortunate know the Qur’an as a translation, which left you desiring something more</li>
                    <li>Similarly, for a lot of people who are fortunate enough to come across the Seerah of the Prophet, it was in the form of a narrative</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s often presented as a fairytale (a long time ago, such and such person lived in a faraway place and did this)</li>
                            <li>The narrative format grips your attention for the time being, but it’s told in a way that leaves you no connection with people in the story (meaning, what am I supposed to do with that?). I was captivated for 30-40 minutes, but what do I with that? It was entertainment, basically</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>So we either have facts, or we have entertainment</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">The purpose of Seerah is asking yourself: what benefit can you take from it?</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Without the facts, we just have a story, but the flowy narrative is important as well because not all of us are students of knowledge or scholars who will be invigorated just by knowing the data and dry facts</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>Not all of us can read code, basically. When I pull up some type of coding for a website, all I see is mumbo-jumbo; it doesn’t make any sense to me. A programmer will go, “Wow! That’s amazing.” A programmer looks at that, and it’s essentially one man’s trash is another man’s treasure</li>
                            <li>For some people, dry facts will work, but that typically involves being a very advanced student of knowledge.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>If we remove the narrative, it’s just dry information. If we remove the dry information, it’s just a narrative, a fairy tale</li>
                    <li>We also need a third component: practicality and relevance</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>How can I apply this to my life? What lessons can I learn from this?</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
        
        <p class="surah">When we look in the Qur’an, Allah turns our attention to the Prophet in Surat Al-Ahzab, “There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.” [33:21]</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Laqad qana lakum fee rasooli Allahi oswatun hasanatun liman kana yarjoo Allaha walyawma al- akhira wathakara Allaha katheera</li>
                    <li>This ayah begins with two levels of emphasis: lam and qad</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>“Most definitely, there is no doubt about the fact...”</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>You could grammatically make the argument that the verb qana is unnecessary. You could deliver the same basic meaning without this verb qana</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>But qana serves as a point of emphasis and gives the meaning of istimrar (whatever message is being conveyed, this message is eternal, universal, continuous, consistent)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>In this ayah, Allah is saying, “Most definitely, there is no doubt about the fact that consistently,
                        without any exception, for all times, that there is exclusively for you, in the Messenger of Allah, the ultimate example, the perfect and most excellent role model.”</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>When you look at the construction of this ayah, there is emphasis and exclusivity built into this ayah (with the way the grammar is laid out)</li>
                                <li>Allah is telling us, make no mistake, have no doubt about the fact, that within the Messenger of Allah, there is for all of us, for all times, a most excellent role model. There is no better role model than the Prophet</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Allah also says fee rasoolillah (in the Messenger of Allah)</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>The word fee has some implications. Basically, Allah is telling us that the Prophet will
                                    only be the ultimate role model for us, when and only when you completely immerse yourself into the life of the Prophet, when you put yourself in the shoes of the Prophet, when you live the life of the Prophet as he lived day by day, event by event. You have to walk through that life, at least conceptually. Then and only then you will realize how much of an amazing example that the Prophet is</li>
                            </ul>
                </ul>
        
        <p class="surah">To truly understand the experience of the Prophet and to be able to realize how you can benefit from the Seerah, the first thing you have to have is an immersing experience – you have to have full understanding of what that life was like</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li> That’s why an in-depth study of the Seerah, stage by stage, day by day, blow by blow, is necessary to get that full understanding of the Prophet</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">When you know just certain facts about Prophet, it’s just factual information. When you have a narrative, it’s a fairytale</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>When you know certain facts like dates, or specific events, or even Hadiths, it just becomes technical facts. “This is how he prayed, this is the Sunnah of doing this and that...”</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>That’s beneficial, sure, but it’s technical</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>What we need more of is the humanization of the Prophet. You start to look at Prophet from a
                        technical point of view (i.e. List of facts like on a resume)</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">The average Muslim tends to present Prophet in a very non-human fashion</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>People who are new to Islam (both youth and re/converts) don’t feel like they have a lot in
                        common with the Prophet</li>
                    <li>Sometimes we have an impression of the Prophet like he’s not even a human being</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">It’s become very common for someone to assume that someone is superior to them, like Superman is from Krypton, and no human being can ever be like Superman. Spiderman got bit by a radioactive spider, and no one else is going to be like that</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>It may seem silly to adults, but when you’re 4 years old and you’re watching Superman/Spiderman, it becomes ingrained within your psyche that you can’t relate to them</li>
                    <li>So when we present the Prophet in a non-human fashion, understand that our youth end up walking away with the same image of the Prophet as they have of Superman, like the Prophet was a man from another planet and that he had nothing to do with us. We have nothing in common with him</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">True, the Prophet was super awesome, in his speech, his charity, his mannerisms, but it becomes ingrained in your psyche that the Prophet is not relatable at all. Like Superman can fly, of course he can fly, he’s Superman, but I can’t fly, because I’m just an earthling. Similarly, that same line of thinking becomes applied to the Prophet, that I can’t relate to the Prophet at all</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Of course, the Prophet should be respected, but he should not become distant to us, where we feel no connection or relationship with him. He shouldn’t become someone I read about that I should go “oooh” and “aaah” about and that’s it</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>That’s a problem that exists</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>But when we study his life, how he lived day by day, when he experienced emotions, how he had
                        a wife and family, how he suffered injury and loss, it humanizes the Prophet</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Hadith refers to the actual traditions and narrations of the Prophet. It includes what he said, what he did,
            what he approved of. Those are narrations about him</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Hadith is technical; it’s quotations and excerpts of his life</li>
                    <li>A lot of times, Hadith is presented without context. It’s meant to be that way, because hadith is a
                        technical tool, a resource</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>The Islamic jurists/legal excerpts derive legal rulings from those Hadiths (what can we
                                    eat/not eat, what can we wear/not wear, how should we pray/not pray, what breaks
                                    your wudu)</li>
                            </ul>
                    <li>Most of our interactions with the Prophet are from those technical hadiths, where we learn about
                        the Prophet’s mannerisms and such, but it’s not part of the overall narrative of the Prophet’s life,
                        which can sometimes dehumanize him</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Hadith shouldn’t be studied exclusively absent of the Seerah</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>We shouldn’t make exclusions</li>
                    <li>The healthy Muslim is the one who has every study of his deen</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>They have basic understanding of fiqh from a scholar, otherwise you wouldn’t even know how to make wudu</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Sometimes we say things like, “Oh, you don’t even know how to read Qur’an, so why study fiqh? Study Qur’an.” Such statements shouldn’t be made</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>You need reevaluate yourself, that if all you do is obsess over fiqh but you don’t even know the basics of Qur’an, then you have a problem, you have an imbalance that you need to correct.</li>
                            <li>On the other hand, if all you do is study Qur’an but you don’t have a basic understanding of fiqh from a proper source/scholar, then you don’t even know how to make wudu</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>A healthy Muslim is the one who has a healthy dose of every field of study – basic fiqh, basic Seerah, basic hadith, and he takes all of this and continues to grow and graduate to different
                        levels within these areas of study</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">For the purpose of practicality, if a Muslim had to make a preference of whether they should indulge in
            the study of hadith or the study of Seerah, when we look throughout the generations of the ummah and how the scholars have handled this issue, you will see that preference was always given to Seerah</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>With the study of Hadith, it wasn’t traditionally the way we approach it today. Same with the study of the Qur’an</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>We read it, translate it, and that’s it. But scholars would study it in depth, and understand it thoroughly. Similarly with hadith, there would be an in-depth study of it</li>
                            <li>Imam Bukhari’s Sahih of Bukhari has 6000-some narrations. His life’s work is 6000 narrations. That’s very little, but that’s how they would approach the in-depth study of hadith</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>The study of Seerah was universally studied. It was something that is meant for all demographics of Muslims, regardless of what your access to scholarship was</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Sunnah is a very subjective and flexible term. It’s a word that has different meaning based on the context in which you use it</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Sunnah includes everything overall, including the Seerah. The Seerah is a part of the Prophet’s Sunnah</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>Everything that’s related to the life and existence of the Prophet is related to Sunnah</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Different meanings of Sunnah:</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>In the field of theology, sunnah is the antonym of bid’ah (tradition vs. innovation)</li>
                    <li>In the field of fiqh, sunnah is another category of fard or wajib (recommended but not obligated
                        vs. mandatory)</li>
                    <li>In the realm of sources, or pure Islamic definitions, then Sunnah is in the company of the Qur’an. You have the Qur’an and the Sunnah</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>As the Prophet said during Hajjat al-Wada, “I leave with you the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Nabi.”</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Sunnah has a place. Overall, sunnah is a terminology and its meaning depends on how you use it</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Hadith has a place, context, and a place where it applies</li>
                    <li>Then you have Seerah; it’s primary role is to humanize the Prophet, to make the common person
                        feel a sense of connection to the Prophet</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Another benefit of studying the Seerah is to extract relevant and practical lessons to apply to every
            demographic of our community</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>You are provided with practical guidance from Seerah on how to live your life</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">In most books of Seerah, you’ll find that Prophethood was divided into two periods</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>The Makkan period of Prophethood was 13 years</li>
                    <li>The Madinan period of Prophethood was 10 years</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">In standard books of Seerah, 3⁄4 of the book will be dedicated to the Madinan period while 1⁄4 is dedicated to the Makkan period</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>The Madinan period has been the fascination of Muslim civilization for the last 1400 years, even though the Makkan period was longer than the Madinan period</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Explanation for this division</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>There are more narrations about the Madinan period than Makkan period, because there were
                        more Sahaba</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>Also, the life, practice, and message of the Prophet was a lot more open in the Madinan
                                    period</li>
                                 <li>The first 3 years of Prophethood (in the Makkan period) were private, because it was
                                    not safe at the time for Muslims. There was no public dawah. There was only private
                                    dawah with close, personal networks in Dar-ul-Arqam</li>
                            </ul>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">In the Madinan period, the message of Islam was very open</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>The entire life of the Prophet was on full display. Most of the Prophet’s activities took place in Masjid al-Nabawi, and his residence was right next door</li>
                    <li>From a surface level, there were more events in the Madinan period, such as Battle of Badr, Battle of Uhud, traveling out the Khyber, Hajjat al-Wida, Fat-hul Makkah, etc.</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Hadith has a very different level of criteria than the Seerah</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>Hadith has to be handed over to the legal experts (fuqaha) to make important decisions about
                        halaal/haraam, while Seerah is about the overall life of the Prophet, which doesn’t have legal implications</li>
                    <li>Seerah includes talking about the morals, and lessons, and sometimes not even that. Sometimes it talks about the Prophet’s emotions, such as the pain and grief he experienced constantly after losing family members throughout his life</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>When you know that after the Prophet’s son (firstborn) died, and he cried, and he grieved, and he had trouble talking to people, you don’t make any halaal/haraam distinction, do you?</li>
                            <li>This just provides you emotional consolation, that the Prophet lost a family member, he felt pain. When someone’s child dies, they’re able to find comfort in the fact that their Messenger felt this very pain and he was able to wake up and carry on the next day</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">We do have quite a bit of info on the Makkan period, but the problem occurred when we started crossing these lines together, when we started to judge everything by the criteria of Hadith</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>When we examined the life and times of the Prophet and his human experiences and started to critique them, “Oh, we’re not getting this from the same chain of narrators that we expect a hadith to come from,” now all of a sudden it became a problem</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>This removes context from the life of the Prophet, when you start to judge Seerah at the same level of criteria for Hadith</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>What we ended up doing was that we ended up filtering a lot of the Seerah from the Makkan period, and we ended up depriving ourselves from an entire era of the life of the Prophet</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">The Makkan period, despite being skirted over in a lot of books of Seerah with relatively few pages, holds a lot of gems for us on how to conduct ourselves, how to thrive, how to blossom and flourish in our community</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>The circumstances we’re in obviously are different from the Makkan period, but we’re not exactly experiencing the Madinan period either. We have to have a full well-rounded appreciation of the life of the Prophet to be able to make sure where we are and how we can improve</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">The Prophet lived up to the age of 63. He spent 23 years of his life as a Prophet, and that doesn’t include his first 40 years, when he wasn’t a Prophet. There are even certain lessons we can extract from the Prophet’s first 40 years</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>If you want to be very strict about it, at the least what you can take from the first 40 years is that you can have a good understanding of what the circumstances and situation were at the time he received Prophethood</li>
                    <li>When we extract practical lessons and relevant insight into the life of the Prophet, we need to delve into all parts of his life – the Makkan period, the Madinan period, and even his life before Prophethood</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Another reason to study the Seerah is that the Prophet is dehumanized a lot, where we don’t feel a connection to him, where we feel that the life of the Prophet is irrelevant to us, like how am I supposed to live my life based on the guidance of a man who lived 1400 years ago in the middle of Arabia? How does that apply to me at all?</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>When you study the Seerah properly, that question is answered</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">There is a fringe issue for the first 1200 years of Islam’s history; mainstream Muslims were never
            affected by this. Over the last 150-200 years, this issue has become front and center so much so that even the average Muslim is concerned about this – the authenticity of the Sunnah and Hadith</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>What is the role of the Prophet in our religion? Is his Hadith and Sunnah true and authoritative? Can I believe in it? Is it made up or not? Can I trust it? If I can trust it at some level, can I hold any authority to it or not?</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>This is a common issue today</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Since this issue has come up, Muslim scholarship has taken the approach of tackling this issue
                        academically and intellectually</li>
                            <ul class="surah">
                                <li>While that approach is completely valid, and there are no academic responses to it
                                    because the system that has been placed to preserve the Hadith of the Prophet is the most elaborate and academically rigorous systems that has been placed in the history of humanity</li>
                            </ul>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Allah has guaranteed the protection and preservation of the Qur’an. In the Qur’an, Allah tells us to follow the Prophet, which means that Allah guarantees that the practice of the Prophet will be preserved</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>The Qur’an has also come to us through a system. There is a chain of transmission for the Qur’an. How do I know that yiyakana budu wa yiyakanas tayin is to be pronounced the way it is? There is a system in place</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>The same system that’s in place to preserve the Qur’an is the same system in place to preserve the Hadith</li>
                            <li>The narrators of Hadith are the same narrators of the Qur’an</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">When you take a look at the issue, it’s not entirely an intellectual or academic issue. It’s a spiritual issue</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>We are told to love the Prophet. What makes you want to obey the Prophet, love the Prophet, study his life is your love for him</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>You can’t love the Prophet if you don’t know who he is, who he was, how he lived his life, and what he did for us</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Learning about someone leads to familiarity. Becoming familiar with someone leads to developing love for that person</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="surah">Starting about a few centuries ago, the Prophet started becoming so unfamiliar to the ummah, and it eventually got to a point where we go, “Do we really have to listen to this guy? Do we have to exactly what he says? Wasn’t he a human being? How do we know what he said was true?”</p>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>It’s a progression that occurred. So what’s the solution? Become familiar with him and study his life. When you start to learn about the Prophet, you will naturally start to love the Prophet. You wouldn’t be able to help but love the Prophet. Once you begin to love him, you will not have any objections to him</li>
                </ul>
