                <li>Ahmad lived through the Abbasi Khalifah</li>
                <li>This fitna was about the creation of Quran and it was started by Jaad ibn Dirham</li>
                <li>The idea was Allah does not speak</li>
                <li>Denial of Allahâ€™s attributes</li>
                <li>Hesham ibn Abdul Malik excecuted Jared</li>
                <li>Than Jahl ibn Sufyan brought the idea back into the Ummah</li>
                <li>The group is called Jahmiyyah who made it popular</li>
                <li>Haroon Rasheed sent order to kill Jahl</li>
