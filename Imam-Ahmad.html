                <li>Ahmad lived through the Abbasi Khalifah</li>
                <li>This fitna was about the creation of Quran and it was started by Jaad ibn Dirham</li>
                <li>The idea was Allah does not speak</li>
                <li>Denial of Allahâ€™s attributes</li>
                <li>Hesham ibn Abdul Malik excecuted Jared</li>
                <li>Than Jahl ibn Sufyan brought the idea back into the Ummah</li>
                <li>The group is called Jahmiyyah who made it popular</li>
                <li>Haroon Rasheed sent order to kill Jahl</li>

            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Rabi ibn Suleiman student of Shafi who accompanied Shafi</li>
                <li>Shafi handed him a sealed letter and sends him back to Iraq</li>

                <li>After Fajr he gave the letter</li>

                <li>Ahmad broke the seal and read it</li>
                <li>His face changed colors and his eyes fled with tears</li>
                <li>After he read it he put his hand on his chest</li>
                <li>Shafi said in the letter he saw Prophet in a dream</li>
                <li>Prophet told Shafi in the dream to write this letter</li>
                <li>And to give him Prophetâ€™s salaam</li>
                <li>He will be tested and told Quran is a creation</li>
                <li>Prophet said do not respond to them and Allah will raise you to a high place</li>

            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Ahmad was asked about Quran and he said it is the word of Allah and not the creation</li>
                <li>They chained up Ahmad in a humiliating way</li>
                <li>They spit at him and cursed him</li>
                <li>The other scholar who said no died along the way</li>
                <li>It was just Imam Ahmad going to see Mamoon</li>
                <li>A Bedouin said stay on the truth you will die anyway</li>
                <li>Ahmad received words of consolation</li>
                <li>The guards said to Imam Ahmad Mamoon is waiting with his sword</li>
                <li>Imam Ahmad made dua that Mamoon would not see him and he will not see Mamoon</li>
                <li>Mamoon died in natural causes</li>
                <li>Mamoon appointed his brother to carry on what he was doing</li>
                <li>Mutasim was his brother who was an idiot brutal and wild</li>
                <li>Mutasim assumed Khalifah and he was asked about Imam Ahmad</li>
                <li>Mutasim left him in jail for three years</li>
                <li>Imam Ahmad is visited by everybody and they tell him to give up</li>
                <li>His uncle even comes to him and says hide your belief</li>
                <li>He said your scholars have done it already</li>
                <li>Imam Ahmad was very sad to hear this</li>
                <li>The 700 scholars are concealing the matter</li>
                <li>Imam Ahmad said he was betrayed by Yahya the scholar who concealed it</li>
                <li>Ahmad grabs his uncles hand and said look outside</li>
                <li>Outside were all the people waiting for Ahmad to say what they wanted him to say</li>
                <li>He feared Allah punishing him for giving up on this matter</li>
                <li>Ahmadâ€™s son came and had no shoes</li>
                <li>Ahmad said to his son be patience Allah will give you something better</li>
