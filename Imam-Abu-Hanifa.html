        <h3 class="surah">Brief History of Kufa</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Abu Hanifa was brought up in the city of Kufa</li>
                <li>Kufa is 6 miles away from Nagf along the banks of the Euphrates River</li>
                <li>Euphrates river is one of the rivers of Jannah </li>
                <li>Kufa, Basra, and Baghdad are the major cities there</li>
                <li>Kufa is a city that developed in Islam</li>
                <li>It was conquered during time of Umar bin Khattab in 636 AH</li>
                <li>Kufa was named after Umar</li>
                <li>Umar sent Saad bin Abi Waqas to Kufa </li>
                <li>Saad Bin Abi Waqas would develop civilizations </li>
                <li>The People of Kufa gave Saad a very hard time</li>
                <li>No governor could handle Kufa</li>
                <li>Umar then replaced saad with Amr Al Yassir and Ibn Masood</li>
                <li>Umar said I am sending Ibn Masood to Kufa despite he needed Ibn Masood</li>
                <li>It was the last straw with the people of Kufa</li>
                <li>Ibn Masood develops Kufa into the city of Quran</li>
                <li>The People of Kufa loved Ibn Masood</li>
                <li>5 Quran recitations originate from Kufa</li>
                <li>Umar sent Mughirah bin Shuba as governor to Kufa</li>
                <li>After Umar Uthman replaced Mughirah with Waleed bin Uqbah</li>
                <li>Then Kufa became a place of Fitnah</li>
                <li>The Khawarrite came out from there</li>
                <li>Kufa revolted against Uthman </li>
                <li>Ali goes to Kufa and moves the Khalifah there, but it did not go well</li>
                <li>Ali was assissnated in the masjid of Kufa by the Khawriite </li>
                <li>Khalifa goes to Hasan and Muawwaih</li>
                <li>Muawwiah establishes Khalifa in Sham</li>
                <li>Muawwiah is the beginning of the Ummayad dynasty</li>
                <li>Kufa never liked Banu Ummayah</li>
                <li>When Yazeed took over, Kufa betrayed Hussein </li>
                <li>Kufa houses graves of early supporters of Hussein like Muslim bin Akeel</li>
                <li>Banu Ummayah would subject the people of Kufa</li>
                <li>The Ummayah Dynasty is a very disturbing Khalifa</li>
            </ul>
