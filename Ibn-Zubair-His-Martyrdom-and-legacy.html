        <p class="surah">Hajaj demolished the Kaaba and it had to be rebuilt once again</p>
        <p class="surah">The army of hajaj was attacked with lightening </p>
        <p class="surah">Hajaj told them it could be Allah accepted them as martyrs</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair and his people were getting weaker </p>

        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair visits his mother </p>
        <p class="surah">Urwa narrates Ibn Zubair enters upon his mother while she is in pain and asks how are you </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said I am in pain</p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said when we die we will feel relieved </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said O my son I don't wish to meet my lord until either you die as a martyr or Allah gives you victory </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said O my mother the people have betrayed me</p>
        <p class="surah">The only ones left are those who cannot carry on any more</p>
        <p class="surah">Ummayads promised him governorship under them</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair says what do you say my mother</p>
        <p class="surah">Asma says O son of Zubair if you know you are on the truth then die on the truth</p>
        <p class="surah">If it is the world you seek then you are a wretched servant </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said O my son for you to be struck by a sword in honor is better than being beat with a whip in humiliation </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said I will only feel sad if you are killed in falsehood</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair says to his mother I just wanted to hear it from you </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma says comes closer to me so I can smell you for the last time</p>
        <p class="surah">What is it you are wearing </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair says it is my armor </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said a brave servant will not need that </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair said I am afraid if I die they will make an example out of me</p>
        <p class="surah">Asma says O my son a sheep does not feel it skinning after it is slaughtered </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair goes out and dresses himself in burial clothes and wearing perfume</p>
        <p class="surah">Asma made dua for Ibn Zubair to accept his deeds </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair goes out and fights and everyone flees and no one fights with him </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Zubair prays Maghreb and he is attacked while in salah </p>
        <p class="surah">The people said takbeer and hajaj mutilated the body </p>
        <p class="surah">A fragrance came from body of Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">Hajaj tied a dead cat to Ibn Zubair but it smelled good as well</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Umar hears and says I remember people saying takbeer when he was born</p>
        <p class="surah">And the people saying takbeer are not the same as those people </p>
        <p class="surah">Peace be on you O Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">I do not remember you except as the one who prays and maintains the ties of kinship</p>
        <p class="surah">Asma wanted to make ghusl to Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Abbas said to Asma martyrs are with Allah they don't need ghusl </p>
        <p class="surah">Hajaj stood there proud</p>
        <p class="surah">Hujjaj said to Asma do you want to talk</p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said after what you did to Ibn Zubair</p>
        <p class="surah">Hajaj said the hypocrite </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma said you may have ruined his world but he ruined your akhira </p>
        <p class="surah">Asma hugged Ibn Zubair and said is it now time for this great warrior to come down</p>
        <p class="surah">The people were disgusted with Hajaj</p>
        <p class="surah">The body was brought down and Asma did not do the ghusl</p>
        <p class="surah">Asma died 2 weeks later in her salah in the year 73 AH </p>
        <p class="surah">The rest of the Abduillah died that same year </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Umar was he last of the Sahaba</p>
        <p class="surah">The sword of Ibn Zubair is still preserved today </p>
        <p class="surah">These people were so connected to Allah that they did not see tradegy as a tragedy </p>
