     <h3 class="surah">Surah Al Fatihah Ayah 4</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>This is a transition</li>
            <li>Turning our attention to Allah directly</li>
            <li>We are involved in a direct conversation with Allah</li>
            <li>Before we were talking about Allah</li>
            <li>Now we are talking to Allah</li>
            <li>Now we are in the prescence of the Divine</li>
            <li>We say You alone do we worship</li>
            <li>We also say You alone are we sustained by</li>
            <li>The nickname of the fatihah is the mother of the book</li>
            <li>This ayah is the mother of the fatihah</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="surah">Why is the worship mentioned before the sustenance?</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>Some scholars say there is no difference</li>
            <li>Other scholars say there is a wisdom in this</li>
            <li>Worship is the goal</li>
            <li>The sustenance is a means to achieve the goal</li>
            <li>We are sustained by Allah in order to worship Him</li>
            <li>We were not created except to worship Allah</li>
            <li>We cannot worship Allah without being sustained by Allah</li>
            <li>Anything that pleases Allah is worship</li>
            <li>Whoever does not worship Allah, worship other than Allah</li>
            <li>Our fitrah is to worship someone or something</li>
            <li>We worship Allah out of love and obedience to the one who deserves to be worshipped</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="surah">The 4 Categories of the People of Worship</h3>
        <ol class="surah">
            <li>The Prophets</li>
            <li>Those who confirmed truth in the Prophets</li>
            <li>The Martyrs</li>
            <li>The Righteous</li>
        </ol>

    <h3 class="surah">How to ask for help from Allah?</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>We receive Allah's help after we put in the effort</li>
            <li>Success = Allah's help + My effort</li>
            <li>A man asked the Prophet should I tie my camel or just trust Allah</li>
            <li>The Prophet said tie your camel and trust Allah</li>
            <li>After you have done everything you could do leave it to Allah</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="surah">The 2 Ways of Asking for Help</h3>
        <ol class="surah">
            <li>Asking Help only from Allah</li>
            <li>Asking Help from other than Allah</li>
                <ol class="surah">
                    <li>Asking Help from someone in which only Allah can do</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>This is totally prohibited</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Asking help from someone while remembering Allah</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>This is permissible</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Asking help from someone and forgetting about Allah</li>
                        <ul class="surah">
                            <li>This is totally prohibited</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
        </ol>

    <h3 class="surah">Surah Al Fatihah Ayah 5</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>Guide us to the straight path</li>
            <li>We ask Allah to increase us in Guidance</li>
            <li>We ask Allah to keep us steadfast upon guidance</li>
            <li>The believers are always concerned about his or her guidance</li>
            <li>We are constantly in need of Allah's guidance and advice</li>
        </ul>

            <li>The Guidance of being guided</li>
            <li>The Guidance of being gifted guidance</li>
        </ol>

    <h3 class="surah">Guidance is only in Allah's Hands</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>The Prophet could show us the straight path</li>
            <li>Only Allah guides whoever He wants</li>
            <li>We cannot guide who we want</li>
            <li>Guidance is in the hearts</li>
            <li>Only Allah controls our hearts</li>
        </ul>
