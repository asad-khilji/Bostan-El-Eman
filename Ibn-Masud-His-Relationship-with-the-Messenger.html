        <h3 class="surah">The Speech of Ibn Masood</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Once the Prophet gave a Khutba and asked Abu Bakr to speak</li>
                <li>Abu Bakr stood up and spoke</li>
                <li>Then he told Umar to stand and speak</li>
                <li>The Prophet approved of what both said </li>
                <li>A third person was asked to stand but he was not mentioned </li>
                <li>Because the Prophet did not like what he said</li>
                <li>The Fourth person to stand was Ibn Masood</li>
                <li>Ibn Masood said O people Allah is our Lord</li>
                <li>Islam is our Religion</li>
                <li>Quran is our Guide</li>
                <li>The House of Allah is our Qibla</li>
                <li>Muhammad is our Messenger</li>
                <li>We are pleased with what Allah and His messenger love and hate what they hate </li>
                <li>Prophet said Ibn Masood has spoken the truth</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Ibn Masood with the Prophet</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Ibn Masood narrates several Hadith about trusting Allah</li>
                <li>The Prophet said if someone is affiliated by poverty and complains it will not end</li>
                <li>But when he complains to Allah Allah will make him independent </li>
                <li>When someone begs from the people he will come on day of judgment with scraps</li>
                <li>A person with atleast 50 dirhams should not beg </li>
                <li>The Prophet would sleep on a straw mat and would have marks on his body</li>
                <li>Ibn Masood suggested to offer Prophet softer bedding but the Prophet declined</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Best of Deeds</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Abu Amr Ah Shaibani was asked What is the best deed </li>
                <li>Ibn Masood told him Salah at its time or beginning time</li>
                <li>After that kindness to ones parents</li>
                <li>Then jihad for the sake of Allah </li>
                <li>Ibn Masood said that one time Prophet tapped him and told him whom the fire is unlawful for</li>
                <li>The Prophet said it is haram for everyone close to the people, friendly, courteous, and easy to deal with </li>
                <li>The Prophet said follow after me Abu Bakr and Umar and be guided by the guidance of Amr Al yassir</li>
                <li>And hold fast to the advice of Ibn Masood </li>
                <li>This was the Prophet's last words </li>
                <li>The Prophet left this world loving two people Amr bin Yassir and Ibn Masood </li>
            </ul>
