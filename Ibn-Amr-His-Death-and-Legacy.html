    <main>

        <p class="surah">Once the Ummah comes together under Hasan, Muawwiah appointed Ibn Amr as the governor of Kufa</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr went into seclusion and worshipped Allah towards the end of his life</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr was very close to Hussein </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein was upset with Ibn Amr for being in that battle and being on other side</p>
        <p class="surah">That hurt Ibn Amr that Hussein was upset with him</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr would try his best to get his attention</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr was on the side of Muawwiah </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein is the most beloved to Allah, His Messenger, and the angels</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr wanted Hussein to forgive him</p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein saw Ibn Amr and was quiet and he ignored him </p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein said how could you fight against my father</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr said he did so because the Prophet told him to be with his father</p>
        <p class="surah">Hussein forgave him and kissed his forehead </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr divided his life into three phases </p>
        <p class="surah">An enemy to the Prophet was the first phase</p>
        <p class="surah">The second phase was when he became Muslim </p>
        <p class="surah">The third phase he is not sure </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr asked the Prophet who you love the most</p>
        <p class="surah">The Prophet responded and said Ayesha, her father, Umar, Uthman, Ali, Hassan, and Hussein</p>
