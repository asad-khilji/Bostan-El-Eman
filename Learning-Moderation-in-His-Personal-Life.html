        <p class="surah">Anas ibn Malik said we were sitting in the company of the Prophet</p>
        <p class="surah">The Prophet said someone will enter upon you from the Ansar who is from the people of Jannah </p>
        <p class="surah">That person was walked in the masjid after just made wudu and his sandals in his left hand</p>
        <p class="surah">The next day the Prophet said someone will enter the masjid who is from the people of Jannah and it was the same man</p>
        <p class="surah">A third day comes and the Prophet say the same thing and he enters again </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr wanted to find out what he did to be a person of Jannah </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr follows the man and he says to him can I stay with you for 3 nights and the man agrees </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr is really excited what the special Ibadah is </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr saw that the man did not do anything extra</p>
        <p class="surah">The man does not pray tahhajud and he does not fast extra days nor does he read extra Quran</p>
        <p class="surah">After the 3 days were over Ibn Amr asked the man what he did for Prophet to say he was a man of Jannah</p>
        <p class="surah">He said before he goes to sleep he forgives everyone </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr starts to understand the deen better and to implement it in moderation</p>
        <p class="surah">The Prophet said a person says subhanallah walhamdulillah Allah hu Akbar 10 times each after each prayer attains Jannah</p>
        <p class="surah">Before going to sleep say Subhanallah 33 times, Alhamdullilah 33 times, Allah hu Akbar 34 times </p>
        <p class="surah">The best act in Islam is to feed the poor people and give salaam to those you know and don't know </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr narrates the virtue of Good Deeds from the Prophet </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr narrated On Judgment day the Qari will be asked to recite Quran and his degree is raised </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr narrated that the Prophet said Fasting and Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Judgment </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr wants to please Allah the way Allah wants him to do so</p>
        <p class="surah">There is a shift in tone of the words of Ibn Amr when he is younger and when he is older </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr said if you were to know about the day of Judgment you would beg Allah for forgiveness until you lost your voice</p>
        <p class="surah">You would pray until your back broke</p>
        <p class="surah">He said if one of you saw a person in Hell you would die from that sight </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr said do not hate the worship of Allah </p>
        <p class="surah">The Prophet told Ibn Amr to be easy on himself </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr said he wished he would take the advice of Prophet </p>
        <p class="surah">With the Prophet the Sahaba only thought of the akhira</p>
        <p class="surah">When we are away from the Prophet we get distracted with the duniya </p>
        <p class="surah">Iman rises during Ramadan and Hajj but what happens later it often crashes down </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr preferred a very humble lifestyle </p>
        <p class="surah">On the day of Judgment most people entering Paradise are the poor people except the rich person giving charity left and right </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr had a lot of patience giving advice to people and he was not judgmental of people </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Amr held the hand of a person who was drunk and he gave him advice </p>
