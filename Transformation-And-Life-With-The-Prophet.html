        <h3 class="surah">The Scholarship of Ibn Amr</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Abdullah memorized the entire Quran in One year first year of being Muslim</li>

                <li>The Prophet said to take the Quran from Ibn Masud, Saad, and Salim</li>
                <li>Abdullah had a great love for Hadith</li>
                <li>Abdullah memorized over 1,000 Hadith and wrote it down</li>
                <li>The Prophet did not want Sahaba to write down the Hadith in the beginning</li>
                <li>So it would not get mixed up with the Quran than later He encouraged it</li>

                <li>Abdullah was very knowledgeable in Hadith</li>
                <li>Hadith collection in the last stages of the Prophet was written</li>
                <li>The ultimate documentation of Hadith was Ibn Amr's book</li>

                <li>Ibn Amr settled in Egypt when it was still developing in Islamic Sciences</li>
