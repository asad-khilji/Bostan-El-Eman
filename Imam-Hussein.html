            <ul class="surah">
                <li>This topic raises a lot of emotions</li>
                <li>It could raise anger among Sunnis and Shia</li>
                <li>This disagreement should remain civil and not become violent </li>
                <li>The purpose of this is just to educate </li>
                <li>Karbala is a detailed and important event in our history</li>
                <li>History is subjective </li>
                <li>This is a concise summary of the Massacre </li>
                <li>It is a condensed version of the History </li>
                <li>Standard Interpretation of Sunni Islam from Ibn Kathir and others </li>

        <h3 class="surah">Ahle Bayt</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Ahle Bayt and the family of the Prophet have a very high rank</li>
                <li>We love them with a genuine love </li>
                <li>It is a very blessed family </li>
                <li>Ahle Bayt are most respected family if they are righteous </li>
                <li>Allah purified Ahle Bayt </li>
                <li>The Prophet put Fatima, Ali, Hasan, and Hussein under his cloak and said these are my Ahle Bayt</li>
                <li>Abu Bakr said to Ali I rather be more kind to Ahle Bayt than my own family </li>
                <li>The Highest amount of money were given to Ahle Bayt</li>
                <li>Umar loved Ahle Bayt so much that he married the daughter of Ali bin Abu Talib</li>
                <li>If the person is not righteous than it does not matter of his or her bloodline</li>
                <li>Whosoever deeds pulled him back his blood will not pull him forward </li>
                <li>Allah will take charge of their affair</li>
                <li>Ahle Bayt consists of Hasan and Hussein and much broader than them</li>
                <li>The Wives of the Prophets are from Ahle Bayt who are our Mothers</li>
                <li>Jafar bin Abu Talib and Akeel and Abbas are descendants of Ahle Bayt </li>
                <li>We do not give zakah to any of the Ahle Bayt and their descendants </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Hussein Bin Ali</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>He was born Shaban 4th hijri less than 1 year from Hasan</li>
                <li>He was born Ramadan 3rd hijri </li>
                <li>Hasan and Hussein are the leaders of the Youth of Jannah </li>
                <li>Hasan and Hussein are the flowers of the duniya </li>
                <li>Hussein was born in Madinah until Ali became Khalifa and moved to Kufa</li>
                <li>Ali was assignated then Hasan was given oath of Allegiance by Kufa</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Political Tension</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Muawwiah was given oath by people of Sham</li>
                <li>for the first time in muslim world there were two Khalifas</li>
                <li>Muawwiah and Hasan were about to go to war but Hasan resigned </li>
                <li>Hasan did not want any bloodshed </li>
                <li>Hasan moved to Madinah and he remained there until the death of Muawwiah </li>
                <li>Then Yazeed came to power and Hussein went to Kufa</li>
                <li>Abdul bin Amr Al As said Hussein is the most beloved man</li>
                <li>Civil war broke out between Sahaba </li>
                <li>A lot of the Muslims lost there lives more than before </li>
                <li>Hasan and Muawwiah almost went to third civil war worse than two </li>
                <li>Hasan said no and let Muawwiah rule</li>
                <li>Hasan was more righteous than Muawwiah yet Hasan gave it up </li>
                <li>Hussein was not happy with his brothers decision but Hasan calmed him down </li>
                <li>Hussein agreed with Hasan's Decision </li>
                <li>Hasan was poisoned </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Banu Ummayah and Banu Hashem</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Banu Ummayah and Banu Hashem were the most elite of Quresh</li>
                <li>There was a lot of rivalry between the two </li>
                <li>Yazeed is Abu Sufyan's grandson and he was not a sahabi </li>
                <li>Yazeed was put in charge of attacking Constantipole in heart of Rum</li>
                <li>Ayub Ansari passed away in that battle his grave was in Turkey Istanbul</li>
                <li>Hussein participated in this same battle against Romans </li>
                <li>Hussein and Yazeed were on same side </li>
                <li>The Prophet said the First Army from my ummah to attack Istanbul shall be forgiven</li>
                <li>With all evil Yazeed got this one blessing</li>
                <li>There were people much more qualified to be Khalifa than Yazeed</li>
                <li>It is allowed of someone of lesser stature to be the Khalifa</li>
                <li>We respect Muawwiah but we do not agree with his political decision</li>
                <li>Muawwiah is a sahabi and he did with concern for Ummah</li>
                <li>Muawwiah did not want any more fighting so he made his son leader</li>
                <li>like Ali made his son leader</li>
                <li>the goal was unity and avoiding bloodshed</li>
                <li>In lifetime of Yazeed and Muawwiah he announced Yazeed is khalifa</li>
                <li>Most of the Ummah agreed except Makkah and Madinah</li>
                <li>Makkah was Ibn Zubair and Madinah was Hasan and Hussein</li>
                <li>Muawwiah died in 60 AH Rajab</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Hussein and the Abadilla</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>There were 3 people who had enough respect and political capablity</li>
                <li>Ibn Umar the senior most sahabi alive in that time and most respected </li>
                <li>Ibn Umar participated in battles and he is a mufti </li>
                <li>Ibn Umar decided to be apolitical and he had the most wisdom </li>
                <li>Ibn Umar was not pro Yazeed but did not make stand against him</li>
                <li>Ibn Zubair was sahabi most respected a political person from young age</li>
                <li>Ibn Zubair revolted from Makkah </li>
                <li>Hussein revolted from Madinah</li>
                <li>Governor of Madinah calls Hussein to his house and asks to give oath of allegiance </li>
                <li>Hussein refused, left to his house, and then packed and left </li>
                <li>the same night Hussein left for Makkah in the middle of night and went to Makkah</li>
                <li>Makkah was less control under Ummayyad</li>
                <li>News spread Hussein fled to Makkah</li>
                <li>People of Kufa rejoiced because they were hoping for revolt</li>
                <li>People of Kufa sent letter to Hussein come we will support </li>
                <li>More than 60 messages came to Hussein </li>
                <li>They said we will not pray Jumuah until you come</li>
                <li>Kufa was a place of sympathy for Ahle Bayt </li>
                <li>It is place where Shiaism was founded </li>
                <li>Ali had a lot of tensions between the people of Kufa</li>
                <li>When Hasan resigned the people of Kufa were not happy </li>
                <li>Now they asked Hussein to do it</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Hussein Bin Ali Sends Muslim Bin Akeel</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Hussein sent his cousin Muslim bin Akeel to go and see in Kufa if they are ready</li>
                <li>Muslim bin Akeel arrives in Kufa in Dhul Qaedah </li>
                <li>People rejoice like they never have before</li>
                <li>More than 12,000 gave the oath of Allegiance directly to Muslim Bin Akeel</li>
                <li>on behalf of Hussein and these 12,000 people represented the bulk of Kufa</li>
                <li>30,000 people claim that they are with Hussein </li>
                <li>Muslim Bin Akeel is excited he has never seen this much support</li>
                <li>He said come immediately do not delay </li>
                <li>Muslim Bin Akeel sent the letter in 60 AH </li>
                <li>It reached Yazeed in Damascus </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Yazeed Bin Muawwiah sends Ibn Zaid to Kufa</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Ibn Ziad was loyal to the Umayyads </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad had no respect from anyone</li>
                <li>Yazeed sends Ibn Ziad with 17 people who was vicious angry and young</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad was 28 years old and he did not act wisely </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad entered with covering his face and people taught he was Hussein </li>
                <li>People of Kufa accidentally exposed the plot to Ibn Ziad</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad sends a spy and founds out who the leader of this movement is  </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad beats up Hani the Governor of Kufa</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad said I just want to know where is Muslim bin Akeel</li>
                <li>Muslim Bin Akeel sends secret message to his followers </li>
                <li>Out of the 12,000 people who gave bayah 4,000 come forward </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad accesses who is out there and tries to cut off each people from them</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad finds out what they need to not support Hussein </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad uses emotional blackmail and asks their parents too to send them home</li>
                <li>Muslim bin Akeel prays Magreb and he turns around and from 30 there is 10 people</li>
                <li>Muslim bin Akeel is now alone with no protection </li>
                <li>The cousin of Hussein is abandoned and it took them 12 hours </li>
                <li>It took them money and bribes </li>
                <li>Muslim Bin Akeel goes to beg and then tells old lady to help him</li>
                <li>She has pity and protects him </li>
                <li>Her son comes home and he exposes Muslim Bin Akeel</li>
                <li>Ibn Akeel knows his whole house is surrounded by troops </li>
                <li>Muslim bin Akeel exits and surrends </li>
                <li>On the way to the governors house Muslim told Ibn Ashar to tell Hussein that Kufa will betray you </li>
                <li>Ibn Ashar promises and does that </li>
                <li>9th of Dhul Hija Muslim bin Akeel is taken to fortress and he is thrown to his death</li>
                <li>His last words were O Allah You be the judge between us and our people </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Hussein Bin Ali and the Other Sahaba in Makah</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>It takes atleast 2 and half weeks for the message to arrive</li>
                <li>Hussein got the first message to come quickly </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad entered Kufa with only 17 men and bribery</li>
                <li>In Madinah Hussein makes his preparation to leave for Kufa</li>
                <li>In Makkah all the senior Sahaba advised against Hussein going to Kufa </li>
                <li>Especially Ibn Abbas told him not to go rather to go to Yemen </li>
                <li>Hussein was insisted to go to Iraq with seeing the letters </li>
                <li>Sahaba said don't you know what they did to your father</li>
                <li>Hussein said no they have changed now </li>
                <li>Hussein takes with him Hasan's children and Ibn Akeel children and Ibn Jafar children </li>
                <li>There were over 100 people including women and children </li>
                <li>Ibn Abbas intercepted the caravan outside Madinah to stop Hussein </li>
                <li>Hussein tells them I would rather die elsewhere than for the haram to be an area of bloodshed </li>
                <li>Hussein did not want a civil war in Makkah </li>
                <li>Abdullah Ibn Umar says to Hussein that Prophet says when Prophet was on his deathbed</li>
                <li>if you want duniya you should have and if you want akhira you choose</li>
                <li>He said Hussein is part of the Prophet</li>
                <li>Ibn Umar said to Hussein you will not get any power because the Prophet asked for the akhira </li>
                <li>Ahle Bayt are not meant for this world and Allah gave them something better </li>
                <li>Absolute power corrupts absolutely </li>
                <li>Ahle Bayt are righteous and pure and Allah has meant something higher for you </li>
                <li>Ibn Umar reminds Hussein don't you remember what he did to his father</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Hussein Bin Ali Heads out to Kufa</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>It is not a black and white issue</li>
                <li>we are on the side of Hussein because we love him </li>
                <li>But it was not the best decision for Hussein or Yazeed </li>
                <li>It would have been better for Hussein to have listened to rest of Ahle Bayt </li>
                <li>Hussein heads out to Kufa with his family over 100 people</li>
                <li>Hussein is very close to Kufa than Ibn Ashar messages reaches him </li>
                <li>Hussein knows the complete story now </li>
                <li>Hussein is persuaded now to abandon </li>
                <li>We do not believe that Hussein marched to suicide </li>
                <li>We believe Hussein believed that he would be victorious </li>
                <li>Hussein decides to march forward </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad requests backing and reinforcement </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad is backed with 4,000 men who were meant to fight a Turkish group </li>
                <li>Hussein goes to Kufa and in Karbala and 4,000 men intercept Hussein</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">3rd of Muharram 61 AH forces of Ibn Ziad came</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Hussein made an announcement whoever wants to leave may leave</li>
                <li>Everyone left except for Ahle Bayt</li>
                <li>Umar bin Saad bin Abi Waqas is military commander and leader is Ibn Ziad</li>
                <li>Umar was a loyal soldier who did what he was told to do but it was bad decision</li>
                <li>the siege lasted 5 or 6 days where they stopped and surrounded on 3rd Muhurram </li>
                <li>Hussein is asked by Umar bin Saeed why he has come </li>
                <li>Hussein said he came because he was invited </li>
                <li>Umar sends the message to Ibn Ziad </li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad said he must come to me and give the oath of allegiance on behalf of Yazeed</li>
                <li>Main culprit is Ibn Ziad and he was arrogant </li>
                <li>Hussein said to Umar bin saad to tell him three options</li>
                    <ol class="surah">
                        <li>to return to Makkah</li>
                        <li>Take him to Yazeed directly because Hussein felt more comfortable talking with him</li>
                        <li>or to send him into exile in some far away lands</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Yazeed would never have killed Yazeed directly</li>
                <li>Friend of Umar said it is reasonable decision</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad refused all three and said either War or my hand</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The 9th of Muharram</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>A small group of people came to the side of Hussein </li>
                <li>All this is happening under the nose of Kufa and no one comes to help</li>
                <li>Hussein refused to go to Ibn Zahid </li>
                <li>10 Muharram 61 AH grandson of Prophet was assignated </li>
                <li>Ali came to the Prophet and who was crying</li>
                <li>Prophet told him Jibril told him that his Ummah shall kill Hussein next to the Euphrates river </li>
                <li>Hussein kept charging on and no one attacked him</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad went forward with few men and they cut the head of Hussein</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad was given the head of Hussein</li>
                <li>Ibn Ziad took a stick and began poking the head of Hussein </li>
                <li>Anas ibn Malik took not stand Ibn Ziad poking the head of Hussein</li>
                <li>Anas Bin Malik said you are poking at the head that the Prophet kissed</li>
                <li>70 people were killed and 15 members from Ahle Bayt</li>
                <li>Ali bin Hussein was spared because he was ill and with the women in the tent</li>
                <li>People of Kufa kept on feeling guilty and 66 AH 10 Muharram group emerged</li>
                <li>and started innovated act of harming themselves lamenting and crying</li>
                <li>for having failed to protect Hussein when Hussein needed there help </li>
                <li>Before Shia was political movement but now it became a theology began to be devised </li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Zaid Bin Ali Bin Hussein in 122 AH</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>The people of Kufa promised him to have his back but they betrayed him again </li>
                <li>Zaid was asked do you curse Abu Bakr and Umar</li>

        <h3 class="surah">Who is to blame for the massacre of Hussein</h3>
            <ul class="surah">

                <li>They blamed the people of Kufa for being afraid and not helping Hussein</li>

                <li>Sahaba said amazing are you people</li>
                <li>you kill Hussein and then you worry about blood of Mosquito </li>

                <li>Ibn Zaid's head was cut off and shown to the people </li>
                <li>Umar bin Saad was coward to Ibn Ziad and he was leader against resistance to Hussein</li>
                <li>the blood of the sword was shimmer who cut the head of Hussein</li>

                <li>Yazeed bin Muawwiah bin Aby Sufyan was in charge and he sent Ibn Ziad </li>
                <li>Yazeed did not send Hussein to be killed but he did nothing abou it afterwards</li>
                <li>Yazeed did not kill a single person for massacre of Hussein </li>
                <li>Yazeed takes a good share of the blame </li>
                <li>Yazeed did not order the killing of Hussein even if he showed sadness he did nothing about it</li>

                <li>Ahmed bin Hanbal said does any believer love Yazeed </li>
                <li>Should we curse him and we do not curse by name rather curse generally </li>
                <li>the people that Yazeed killed are not your average people </li>
                <li>We leave his affair to Allah</li>
