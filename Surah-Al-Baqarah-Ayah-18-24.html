        <h1>Surah Al Baqarah: Ayah 18-24</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

      <h3 class="surah">صُمٌّۢ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌۭ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ</h3>
        <ul class="surah">
            <li>They are Deaf, they cannot hear, and they cannot be heard</li>
            <li>They are Mute and they cannot speak</li>
            <li>They are blind, they cannot see, and they cannot be seen</li>
            <li>Their ability to hear the guidance is taken away</li>
            <li>Their ability to see the character of the Prophet or Muslims is taken away</li>
            <li>Their ability to ask for the guidance is taken away</li>
            <li>They have been abandoned</li>
            <li>They are not going to return to the guidance or the fire that was lit</li>
            <li>They will not be returning back to the Messenger to be guided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَـٰتٌۭ وَرَعْدٌۭ وَبَرْقٌۭ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَـٰبِعَهُمْ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ مُحِيطٌۢ بِٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Or like dark clouds with really heavy rain that comes from the sky</li>
                <li>This example is compared to the one before</li>
                <li>Revelation is comforting and provides you heat and warmth</li>
                <li>Revelation is also harsh and intense</li>
                <li>There is also thunder and lightening</li>
                <li>The warnings of the Quran are intense and scary</li>
                <li>They put their fingers in their ears because of the loud sound like an explosion</li>
                <li>This storm keeps on happening</li>
                <li>They put their fingers in their ears out of fear of death</li>
                <li>When the hypocrite hears the Quran he does not want to hear it</li>
                <li>He sticks his fingers in his hears and blocks out the Quran</li>
                <li>The hypocrites have lost their intellect too and they have become illogical</li>
                <li>Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers</li>
                <li>Allah calls the hypocrites as disbelievers</li>
                <li>Because Allah knows what is in their hearts</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">يَكَادُ ٱلْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَـٰرَهُمْ ۖ كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْا۟ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا۟ ۚ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَـٰرِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌۭ</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>The lightening almost snatches their eyesight away</li>
                <li>The light of revelation is so strong that they are blinded by it</li>
                <li>When it lights the way for them they walk, but when it is dark they stand still</li>
                <li>The hypocrites follow the revelation when it is convenient for them</li>
                <li>Had Allah wanted He could have taken away their hearing and their seeing</li>
                <li>Allah is over all things completely capable</li>
                <li>In the previous example Allah did take their hearing and seeing away</li>
                <li>But in this example they can still see and hear</li>
                <li>These people still have a chance to come back to the guidance</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>People enslave yourselves to your Master completely in slavery and worship</li>
                <li>Who created you and those much before you</li>
                <li>So that you may hopefully protect yourselves</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ فِرَٰشًۭا وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَآءًۭ وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءًۭ فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ رِزْقًۭا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا۟ لِلَّهِ أَندَادًۭا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Who made the earth for you as a comfortable floor spread out</li>
                <li>Who made the earth humbled for you</li>
                <li>And He made the sky as a ceiling</li>
                <li>The earth was meant to be a source of protection for you</li>
                <li>And He sent down water from the sky</li>
                <li>Then He extracted from it all kinds of fruits</li>
                <li>Then do not set up competitors with Allah</li>
                <li>While you people know very well</li>
                <li>Hypocrisy includes emotional or intellectual issues</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍۢ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا۟ بِسُورَةٍۢ مِّن مِّثْلِهِۦ وَٱدْعُوا۟ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـٰدِقِينَ</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>And if in fact you are in any doubt about what We sent down upon our slave</li>
                <li>Then bring anything remotely like a surah in the Quran</li>
                <li>And call upon all your witnesses other than Allah</li>
                <li>If you happen to be truthful</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُوا۟ وَلَن تَفْعَلُوا۟ فَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِى وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ ۖ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَـٰفِرِينَ</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>But if you are not able to do so</li>
                <li>And you will never be able to do so</li>
                <li>Then protect yourselves from the fire whose fuel is men and stones</li>
                <li>It has been prepared for the disbelievers and for the ungrateful</li>
            </ul>
