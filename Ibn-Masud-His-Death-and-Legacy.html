    <main>

        <p class="surah">The fitna started to boil for Uthman while Ibn Masood was still alive</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood declared that he had no personal issues with Uthman </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood only spoke good of Uthman</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood narrated many Hadith about the fitnah </p>
        <p class="surah">The Prophet said there are young people foolish in minds and Quran does not go past their throats </p>
        <p class="surah">The Prophet pointed towards Yemen and said Iman is towards this side</p>
        <p class="surah">And harshness and cruelty is towards Najd </p>
        <p class="surah">The two horns of the devil will arise from there</p>
        <p class="surah">The Prophet said fulfill the rights upon you and avoid harming people in the end of times</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood asked Allah for him to leave the world before the fitnah starts </p>
        <p class="surah">He died 39 years before the Abdillah</p>
        <p class="surah">During that time Ibn Masood got sick and while he was sick Uthman came to visit </p>
        <p class="surah">Uthman said what is causing you this sickness </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood said my sins </p>
        <p class="surah">Uthman said what do you desire</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood said I want the mercy of My Lord </p>
        <p class="surah">Uthman said Should I get a doctor for you</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood said the doctor is the one who prescribed my sickness (Allah)</p>
        <p class="surah">Uthman said should I give you wealth </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood said I do not need anything from this world </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood said the shahdah and passed away</p>
        <p class="surah">Az Zubair led his Janaza </p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood passed away right before the fitna happened </p>
        <p class="surah">There is no one left who has more knowledge than Ibn Masood </p>
        <p class="surah">Not knowledge and not Ibadah</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood's legacy is the Quran</p>
        <p class="surah">Kufa became the city of Quran</p>
        <p class="surah">Kufa produced the scholars of Quran and manufacturers the Quran</p>
        <p class="surah">The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it </p>
        <p class="surah">Alqama recited just like Ibn Masood </p>
        <p class="surah">In the science of recitation there are 10 recitations</p>
        <p class="surah">All these recitations are from Kufa and Ibn Masood taught them </p>
        <p class="surah">Ali came to Kufa and said Ibn Masood filled this city with knowledge </p>
        <p class="surah">Because of Ibn Masood 1500 companions took residents in Kufa</p>
        <p class="surah">70 of them are veterans from Badr</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood turned the city into a center for learning</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood's students were Alqama and Masuk</p>
        <p class="surah">They were the greatest students </p>
        <p class="surah">The knowledge stopped with Umar bin Khattab, Ali bin Abu Talib, Ibn Masood, Mouadh bin Jabal, Abu Darda, and Zaid bin Thabit </p>
        <p class="surah">Alqama met all the companions </p>
        <p class="surah">In Kufa Alaqma and Masuk teach Ibrahim and Shabi, the teacher of Imam Abu Hanifa</p>
        <p class="surah">Imam Hanifa takes his fiqh from Ibn Masood </p>
        <p class="surah">Fiqh is more important to you as food</p>
        <p class="surah">Ibn Masood was greatest with knowledge </p>
        <p class="surah">Alqama came and watered the crops</p>
        <p class="surah">Hamad nurtured it</p>
        <p class="surah">Imam Abu Hanifa grounded it</p>
        <p class="surah">Abu Yusuf made dough from it</p>
        <p class="surah">Shaibani baked the dough </p>
        <p class="surah">Muslims have been eating the dough ever since</p>
